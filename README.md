# Web Development Project: Storehouse Website

This is a website that I made with a few classmates for Storehouse Project, a nonprofit orgnaization near Fairfield Connecticut. The goal of Storehouse is to provide food and other baic life necessities for people who are unable to provide for themselves.

Our goal of this project was to create a modern and engaging website.

We worked very closely with Storehouse managers, ensuring smooth and easy communication.
