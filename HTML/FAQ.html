        <h3>What is food insecurity?</h3>
        <p class="Content">According to Feeding America, Food security is a federal measure of a household’s ability to provide enough food for every person
           in the household to have an active, healthy life. Food insecurity is one way we can measure the risk of hunger.

          One "bad month" can be enough to plunge a household into food insecurity. Lay-offs at work, unexpected car maintenance or an accident 
          on the job can suddenly force a family to choose between buying food and paying bills. Working families across America face countless 
          situations that can result in food insecurity and hunger.

          That’s why many working families, including thousands of households who don’t qualify for federal nutrition assistance, depend on food 
          banks and pantries like The Storehouse Project to help make ends meet during difficult times.

        </p>
        <h3>How many meals do you provide each year?</h3>
        <p class="Content">We provided over 250,000 meals in 2018 through our Food Pantry, Mobile Food Pantry, Community Dining Centers and Thanksgiving Basket Distribution. 
        </p>
        <h3>How many people are food insecure in CT?</h3>
        <p class="Content">The food insecurity rate in Connecticut in 2017 was 11.3% meaning that 406,810 people were food insecure. For more information click 
          here <a style="color: unset"style="text-shadow: unset" href="https://map.feedingamerica.org/county/2017/overall/connecticut ">(https://map.feedingamerica.org) </a>

        <h3>How can I help?</h3>
        <p class="Content">1.	Food and Clothing –  We always need warm coats and gently used clothing for men, women, and children. Please drop off your 
          gifts at 192 Meadow St, Milford. We are open for donations Tuesday – Friday from 9am – 5pm.  Please email <a style="color: unset"href="mailto:info@storehouseprojectct.org">info@storehouseprojectct.org</a>
          with any questions.
          <br><br>

        <h3>How will the money be used?</h3>
        <p class="Content">
          Aside from maximizing our capacity to feed those in need by supplementing the food we receive from the Connecticut Food Bank, funding 
          also enables us to maintain our vehicles  and buy necessary supplies for our Stationary Pantry, Mobile Food Pantry, Community Dining 
          Centers, and Thanksgiving Basket Distribution. In our long range plans, additional vehicles, storage space (including cold and dry good 
          storage) will be increasingly imperative, 

          Food insecurity is often symptomatic of many other poverty-related maladies. It is our strong desire and full intention to help move 
          people out of the pit of poverty in as many ways as can. We’re currently considering a variety of ways to come alongside individuals to 
          be of help in that endeavor. Support as basic as an available hot shower and washer/dryer setup to a medical clinic, legal counsel and 
          employment counseling are being considered. In whatever direction we go, funding for facilities, training and staffing will be required. 

        </p>
